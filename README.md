# ghidra-themes
A collection of themes for ghidra to make long hours of reverse-engineering even more enjoyable!

(Shout out the O.G. [dark mode](https://github.com/zackelia/ghidra-dark) for carrying me through the dark days, the new theme for that is [here](https://github.com/zackelia/ghidra-dark-theme))

2. In the Ghidra landing page, click `Edit` on the top right of the screen
3. Then hover over `Theme` and click `Import...`
4. Locate and select the `*.theme` file you downloaded earlier
5. The theme should now be installed!
