# ghidra-themes
A collection of themes for ghidra to make long hours of reverse-engineering even more enjoyable!

(Shout out the O.G. [dark mode](https://github.com/zackelia/ghidra-dark) for carrying me through the dark days, the new theme for that is [here](https://github.com/zackelia/ghidra-dark-theme))
